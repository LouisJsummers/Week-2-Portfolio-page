## Challenges to complete

- WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### Solutions

- For the first challenge ive added my name and a photo of myself with the relevent links of "about", "portfolio work" and "contact". I also added another section "technologys" to show some of the languages that I know so far.
- For the second challenge I have linked up the nav bar links to the relevent part of the page. For example when you click "about" it will drop down to a short paragraph about myself.
- Point 3 is the navigation to the work section of the page, so that will be to the tiles of previous work projects.
- For challenge 4 I couldnt work out how two create the 2nd,3rd,4th etc tiles smaller than the first.
- Point 5 was to link the project pages to the live page itself so i did that using href attribute then the relevent addrress as the value all in an anchor tag.
- Lastly was to make the page responsive, so I used media queries to do this. I changed some of the properties like size and colour of headings to accomodate the smaller screen sizes.
